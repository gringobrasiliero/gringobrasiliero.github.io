Reflecting back, I remember when I first started my course at Flat Iron. I was a novice in Scratch, and I knew I had a lot to learn. With the persistence and hard work, I am now creating curriculums to teach others how to program. I am currently creating curriculums to teach web development in the front end (HTML, CSS, and JS), as well as the back end in Python, which is not something I specifically learn through Flat iron.

I did notice though that me knowing how to use Ruby, it can be easily translated over to Python. To me all it is is a different syntax. Since they are both OO languages, the structure of programs are the same, just worded differently. It is very similar to translating from Portuguese and Spanish. I feel that knowing multiple languages has really helped me to adapt to different languages. 

Now I am midway through the Rails section of my course, and I am beginning to see the light. Understanding how applications and websites work, as well as discovering the true potential of what I can do with the power of code. It is an amazing feeling, and I am happy that I am now able to teach others in order to pass that amazing feeling of understanding to others. 

I have also implemented the applications that I have made in my teaching lessons to make it an interactive way to teach how the internet works! My students are really amazed to see how I can run a server off of my laptop, and them being able to see the requests from their computer to my computer gets them really excited to create their own websites.
