For my Sinatra Portfolio project, I created a project sharing website. At the Coder School, we teach kids computer programming, and I saw that we needed a way to share different projects for our students to work on between Code Coaches that work there. On this CRUD app, you can create projects, edit the projects so you can add additional information, any links to the projects, and the type of project that it is. I feel that it is a good way to share project materials between Code Coaches so that our students have a wide variety of projects to work on, and our Code Coaches can find projects that are well suited for the students they have.

When I first started this project, I was getting slow progress because I did not know where to start. Creating tests helped me a lot to give me direction, and made sure my project was working. It was a learning experience for me because I saw first hand how important it was to have tests. 

Creating the project, I realized that I had to repeat a lot from the twitter project, as a bit of the code was redundant. It was excellent practice. I feel so accomplished being able to create my own CRUD application, and I feel more and more like a Full Stack Developer every day.
